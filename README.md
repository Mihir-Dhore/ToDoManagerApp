I have created a To-Do Manager where users can view both upcoming and completed tasks. In the "Upcoming" section, users have the options to mark tasks as complete or delete them. Once a user marks a task as done, it automatically transitions to the "Completed" section, where they have the option to delete completed tasks as well. This two-step process ensures a clear distinction between active and completed tasks, allowing users to efficiently manage their to-do list.
